## Course Description
Kotlin Multiplatform makes it easier to share code across Android, iOS, JVM, web, and backend platforms. This course will teach you how to create and publish a KMP library step-by-step. You’ll learn how to set up a project, write and test cross-platform code, and handle platform-specific implementations. By the end, you’ll be ready to publish your library to Maven Central and maintain it effectively. The course will primarily use JetBrains Fleet for project setup and shared code development, while platform-specific tasks will involve Android Studio and Xcode. This course is perfect for developers looking to adopt Kotlin Multiplatform and streamline their workflows.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- Android Studio with Kotlin Multiplatform Plugin
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
